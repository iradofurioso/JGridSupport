# JGridSupport

JGridSupport: is a JavaScript class/library intended to give support for app or game developers 
during the development phase. JGridSupport shows a grid on canvas helping the alignment of elements 
in its exact position. JGridSupport can be used for other objectives if needed for example in the 
testing phase, helping Software Testers check if all elements on canvas are aligned correctly.
